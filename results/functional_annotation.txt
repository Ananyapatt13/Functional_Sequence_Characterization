Interpretation:
The top BLAST hit corresponds to a protein annotated as an ESX-1 secretion system protein (EccA1) from Mycobacterium species.

Based on this homology, the target protein is predicted to be involved in protein secretion via the ESX-1 secretion system.

This functional prediction is inferred from sequence similarity and has not been experimentally validated.
