BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION

The target protein sequence was analysed using a stepwise bioinformatics
pipeline involving sequence quality assessment, homology search, and
functional annotation.

Sequence quality analysis confirmed that the protein is of sufficient
length (573 amino acids) and suitable for downstream analysis.

BLAST-based homology search identified the closest homologs as ESX-1
secretion system protein EccA1 from multiple Mycobacterium species,
including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The presence of a full-length
alignment with an E-value of 0.0 indicates strong evolutionary
conservation.

Based on the annotation of the top BLAST hits, the protein is predicted
to function as an ATPase component of the ESX-1 (Type VII) secretion
system. This system is known to play an important role in protein
secretion and virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Therefore, the analysed sequence is likely to be involved in ESX-1
mediated secretion processes that contribute to bacterial pathogenicity.
This functional interpretation is inferred from sequence similarity and
has not been experimentally validated.
